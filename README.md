# offseason-bot-2024
This bot is our designated outreach bot. It intakes wiffle balls from the top and shoots them out the front.
It has the following subsystems:
- drivetrain with two wheels per side
- small indexer wheel on the inside of the curved intake path (one SparkMax)
- shooter with two wheels (two SparkMaxes)
We would like an arcade drive and an automated shooting process at at least one distance, preferably two.
